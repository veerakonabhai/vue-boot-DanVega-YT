1) we created this project using terminal("vue create frontend"), vue-cli is needed.
2) we make changes in App.vue so that it talks with backend and takes it's response to display in frontend
3) we need to start the SpringBootApplication before running the frontend
4) run frontend using cmd "npm run serve"
